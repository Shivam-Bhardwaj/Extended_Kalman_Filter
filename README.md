The following project is a part of Udacityâ€™s Self Driving car engineering NanoDegree program. The aim of project is to successfully implement Kalman filter in C++ on LIDAR and RADAR data to obtain a smooth curvature of the car in the simulator. 

Passing the project requires obtaining Root Mean Square Error values that are lower than the tolerance outlined in the project rubric.

| /cmake-build-release | Build files of the project              |
| /data                | LIDAR and RADAR data                    |
| /src                 | source file for the project in c++      |
| ./term2_sim.x86_64   | 64 bit version of the simulator         |
| term2_sim_Data       | unity data for simulator                |
| CMakeList.text       | Cmake list to build the project         |

This project involves the Term 2 Simulator which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases). Which is also included in the repository for Linux.

## Other Important Dependencies

- cmake >= 3.5
  - All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
- make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  - Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  - Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  - Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
- gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  - Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  - Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  - Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Use the install.sh scripts for installing uWebSocketIO  
3. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
4. Compile: `cmake .. && make` 
   - On windows, you may need to run: `cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles" && make`
5. Run it: `./ExtendedKF `

Here is the main protocol that main.cpp uses for uWebSocketIO in communicating with the simulator.


**INPUT**: values provided by the simulator to the c++ program

["sensor_measurement"] => the measurement that the simulator observed (either lidar or radar)

**OUTPUT**: values provided by the c++ program to the simulator

["estimate_x"] <= kalman filter estimated position x

["estimate_y"] <= kalman filter estimated position y

["rmse_x"]

["rmse_y"]

["rmse_vx"]

["rmse_vy"]

### Discussion

To begin with I would like to thank Udacity team for compiling everything in such an amazing tutorial. Following are my take on the overall project.

- When 

The code was tested on the following specifications

- **CPU:** `Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-8950HK CPU @ 4.8 Ghz`
- **GPU:** `Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti Mobile`
- **OS:** `Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS (Xenial Xerus)` 
- **Kernal:** `4.15.0-48-generic`
